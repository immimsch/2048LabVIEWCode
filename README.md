# 2048LabVIEWCode
2048 Game in LabVIEW. Implement a simple QMH framework and a 2D picture ring to achieve the functionality. The game starts with two "2" elements and generates one "2" element after a move. The game is over when there are 16 elements on the board and no merge after a moveâ€”and winning when one "2048" element is created.
