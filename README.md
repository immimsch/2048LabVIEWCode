# 2048 LabVIEW Code
2048 Game in LabVIEW. Implement a simple QMH framework and a 2D picture ring to achieve the functionality. The game starts with two "2" elements and generates one "2" element after a move. The game is over when there are 16 elements on the board and no merge after a move—and winning when one "2048" element is created. 

Develop Environment: LabVIEW 2020 f1 32bits—no additional toolkit needed.
